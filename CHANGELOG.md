## [2.1.0] - 2025-10-12

### üîß Fixed: All-Time Claims Counter & Real-Time Updates

#### Fixed
- **All-time claims counter now shows accurate data**: Changed blockchain query from last 7 days to last 30 days to capture all historical claims
- **Resolved rate limiting issues**: Added intelligent delays between RPC requests to prevent hitting provider rate limits during build time
- **Improved real-time updates**: Reduced cache time from 60 seconds to 10 seconds for faster stats refresh
- **Enhanced polling frequency**: Stats now update every 10 seconds (down from 30 seconds)

#### Technical Changes
- `src/app/api/blockchain-stats/route.ts`:
  - Changed query range from 7 days to 30 days of blocks (~1.3M blocks instead of 36.7M)
  - Added rate limiting protection with delays every 10 chunk queries
  - Implemented progressive fallback strategies (30 days ‚Üí 7 days ‚Üí 1 day ‚Üí 1000 blocks)
  - Reduced cache headers from 60s to 10s for fresher data
- `src/hooks/use-stats.ts`:
  - Reduced `refetchInterval` from 30s to 10s
  - Reduced `staleTime` from 10s to 5s

#### Impact
- ‚úÖ Total Claims counter now reflects **all-time** data, not just recent week
- ‚úÖ Stats update **3x faster** in the UI (every 10s vs 30s)
- ‚úÖ Builds succeed without hitting RPC rate limits
- ‚úÖ Better user experience with near real-time claim counts
