# ✅ Neynar Score Requirement - Setup Complete

## What Was Implemented

Your faucet now requires users to have a **minimum Neynar score of 0.5** to claim ETH. This prevents spam and ensures fair distribution to legitimate, active Farcaster users.

---

## 🎯 Key Features

### ✅ Real Spam Prevention
- **Minimum score:** 0.5 (on a 0-1 scale)
- **Real-time checking:** Via Neynar API
- **No infrastructure needed:** Uses existing Neynar integration
- **Enabled by default:** Active in production

### 💎 User Experience
- Shows actual score to users
- Clear messaging if below minimum
- Helpful tips for improving score
- Graceful error handling (fail-open)

### 🔧 Technical Implementation
- API endpoint: `/api/check-spam-label` (reused for backward compatibility)
- Checks: `user.experimental.neynar_user_score` from Neynar API
- Hook: `useSpamLabelCheck` (same name, new functionality)
- Config: `NEXT_PUBLIC_SPAM_LABEL_REQUIRED=true` (default)

---

## 📊 How It Works

### User Flow

1. **User connects wallet** in Farcaster
2. **Neynar score is fetched** using their FID
3. **Score is checked** against minimum (0.5)
4. **Result is displayed:**
   - ✅ **Score ≥ 0.5:** "Verified Account ✓" (shows score)
   - ❌ **Score < 0.5:** "Reputation Too Low" (shows current score)
   - ⏳ **Loading:** "Checking account reputation..."
   - ⚠️ **Error:** "Temporarily unavailable - You can still claim!"

### What Gets Checked

```
Claim allowed if ALL true:
✓ Connected wallet
✓ Base network
✓ Not in cooldown (24h)
✓ Farcaster platform
✓ Following @vinu07 (if enabled)
✓ Neynar score ≥ 0.5 ← NEW!
```

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Current Settings

**Environment Variable:**
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SPAM_LABEL_REQUIRED=true  # Enabled by default
```

**Minimum Score:**
```typescript
// In src/app/api/check-spam-label/route.ts
const MINIMUM_SCORE = 0.5
```

### To Disable Neynar Score Check

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SPAM_LABEL_REQUIRED=false
```

### To Adjust Minimum Score

Edit `src/app/api/check-spam-label/route.ts`:

```typescript
const MINIMUM_SCORE = 0.5  // Change this

// Recommended values:
// 0.3 = Very lenient (allows most users)
// 0.5 = Balanced (default, good spam prevention)
// 0.7 = Strict (only established accounts)
// 0.9 = Very strict (only highly reputable)
```

## 🛡️ Error Handling

The implementation is **fail-open** to protect legitimate users:

| Scenario | Behavior | Reasoning |
|----------|----------|-----------|
| Neynar API down | ✅ Allow claim | Don't block users for API issues |
| API quota exceeded | ✅ Allow claim | Graceful degradation |
| Network error | ✅ Allow claim | Temporary issues shouldn't block |
| No API key | ✅ Allow claim | Development mode |
| Score < 0.5 | ❌ Block claim | Only block for confirmed low score |

## 📈 What is Neynar Score?

**Neynar User Score** is a reputation metric (0-1) that reflects:
- Account activity and engagement
- Social graph quality
- Content quality
- Time on platform
- Community interaction

**Higher scores indicate:**
- More established accounts
- Active, engaged users
- Quality content creators
- Legitimate community members

**Lower scores may indicate:**
- New accounts (recently created)
- Inactive accounts
- Limited engagement
- Potential spam/bot accounts

## 🧪 Testing

### Test Different Scenarios

1. **User with high score (≥ 0.5):**
   - Should see: "Verified Account ✓ (Score: X.XX)"
   - Can claim ETH

2. **User with low score (< 0.5):**
   - Should see: "Reputation Too Low"
   - Current score displayed
   - Cannot claim

3. **API error:**
   - Should see: "Temporarily unavailable - You can still claim!"
   - Can claim (fail-open)

   - Score distribution of claimers
   - Rejection rate by score
   - Trends over time

3. **Personalized messages:**
   - Tips for improving Neynar score
   - Show what affects the score
   - Progress tracking

4. **A/B testing:**
   - Test different minimum thresholds
   - Measure spam reduction vs user friction

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Issue: All users being blocked

**Check:**
1. Is `NEYNAR_API_KEY` set correctly?
2. Is Neynar API quota exceeded?
3. Check API logs for errors

**Solution:**
- Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_SPAM_LABEL_REQUIRED=false` temporarily
- Check Neynar API status
- Verify API key is valid

### Issue: No score being displayed

**Check:**
1. Is the user in Farcaster?
2. Check browser console for errors
3. Verify API response format

**Solution:**
- Ensure user has valid FID
- Check Neynar API response structure
- Verify `experimental.neynar_user_score` exists
